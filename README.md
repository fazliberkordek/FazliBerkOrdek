This is Fazlƒ± Berk √ñrdek, an Electrical and Electronics Engineer and a Master's student in Physics. My primary goal is to refine my skills as a researcher and make substantial contributions to the advancements in Science and Technology. Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently pursued opportunities to enhance my professional growth. Importantly, I possess the ability not only to ask pertinent questions but also to recognize the crucial inquiries that can drive progress in this expansive and specialized field.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I am deeply passionate about research and am concurrently engaged as a Full Stack Software Engineer freelancer. This dual interest has led me to specialize in two major disciplines:

1) Gradute Researcher-Scientist:
Specifically, I am actively involved in the ANNIE experiment at Fermilab. Within this context, I conduct data analysis for physics-related aspects as well as neutron analysis for ANNIE. Furthermore, I contribute to the development of software and DLLN applications intended for the Phase 2 of the ANNIE experiment.

2) Full Stack Software Engineering :
I have also established myself as a skilled Full Stack Software Engineer. Notably, I was both a fellow and Software Engineer in the Google Turkey OVUA program. In this capacity, I designed and developed cross-platform mobile and web applications, with a particular focus on the various industries.
